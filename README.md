# recommender_system
The dataset used for the item-based collaborative filtering model is downloaded from the MovieLens website, a popular movie recommendation platform and research resource. The specific dataset used in this case is the "1 Million Plus" dataset, which contains over one million movie ratings. 

Each component plays a crucial role in building and evaluating the recommender system.
1.	Movie Ratings:
•	This dataset contains information about the ratings given by users to various movies.
•	It typically includes three key fields: UserID, MovieID, and Rating.
•	The UserID represents the unique identifier of the user who rated the movie.
•	The MovieID represents the unique identifier of the movie being rated.
•	The Rating represents the numeric rating given by the user to the movie (usually on a scale of 1 to 5).
2.	Movie Information:
•	This dataset contains information about each movie in the dataset.
•	It may include fields like MovieID, Title, Genre, Release Year, etc.
•	The Title field provides the name of the movie, helping users to identify it easily.
•	The Genre field specifies the category or genre to which the movie belongs.
•	The Release Year field indicates the year the movie was released.
3.	User Information:
•	This dataset contains additional information about the users in the system.
•	It may include fields like UserID, Age, Gender, Occupation, etc.
•	The Age field provides the age group of the user.
•	The Gender field specifies the user's gender (male or female).
•	The Occupation field denotes the user's profession or occupation.


Application of the Model:
The implemented item-based collaborative filtering model with adjusted cosine similarity has various practical applications in the domain of personalized recommendation systems for movies or any other items. It enables the system to predict movie ratings and generate personalized movie recommendations for individual users. This application can be utilized in online movie platforms, streaming services, or e-commerce platforms, where providing personalized recommendations is crucial for enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

Limitations of the Model:
The current limitation of the model is that it can only predict ratings for a single user at a time. While the model can generate accurate predictions for individual users, it lacks the ability to scale and predict ratings for all users simultaneously. This constraint hinders its efficiency in large-scale applications with a substantial user base.

Future Scope of the Model:
To overcome the limitation and enhance the model's scalability and usability, the future scope of this model involves the following advancements:

1. Parallel Processing:
   Implement parallel processing techniques to predict ratings and generate recommendations for multiple users simultaneously. This optimization can significantly speed up the process and improve the overall performance of the recommender system.

2. Accuracy Rate for All Users:
   Develop a mechanism to calculate the accuracy rate for predictions made for all users in the dataset. This will enable comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the model's performance for different users and highlight areas for further improvement.

By addressing the limitations and incorporating these future enhancements, the item-based collaborative filtering model can evolve into a powerful and scalable recommender system, providing highly personalized movie recommendations for a broad user base. This would significantly enhance user satisfaction and engagement, making the platform more appealing and competitive in the movie recommendation market.
